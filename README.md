# üõ¨ SVO Airport Personnel Management System üõ´

The SVO Airport Personnel Management System is a powerful tool designed to provide the most relevant tasks to the nearest personnel who have the competencies to perform them. Developed during a hackathon, this system is specifically designed to help airport managers quickly respond to problems and efficiently allocate personnel resources.

## How It Works

When a manager identifies a problem at the airport, such as a security issue, electrical problem, or cleanliness issue, they can open the SVO Airport Personnel Management System and notify the closest personnel with the necessary competencies. The system then sends notifications to the selected personnel on their mobile phones via a mobile application, which is also used for location tracking.

The mobile application provides GPS and iBeacon technology to track personnel location and help determine which floor they are on. The personnel can quickly respond to the problem and resolve it, making the airport run more smoothly and efficiently.
